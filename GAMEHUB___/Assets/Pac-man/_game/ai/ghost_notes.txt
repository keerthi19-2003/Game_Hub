Notes on intended Ghost Behaviour 
===================================

  * Ghost Behaviour is based on what is described in the
  * following article:
  * https://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior

General Ghost Traits
===========================

- Ghosts dont ever reverse their current direction! (very important)

- Every Ghost operates in two Modes: Scatter (go to a designated
corner in the screen) and Chase (chase a target tile positioned
in some relation to player position)

- Changes between Chase and Scatter modes occur on a fixed timer. 
This timer is  reset at the beginning of each level and whenever 
a life is lost. The timer is also paused while the ghosts are in 
Frightened mode, which occurs whenever the player eats a 
Power-Pellet.

    LEVEL START: 
        - Scatter for 7 seconds, then Chase for 20 seconds.
    70% PELLETS CONSUMED: 
        - Scatter for 5 seconds, then switch to Chase mode 
          permanently.

- Frightened mode is unique because the ghosts do not have a 
specific target tile while in this mode. Instead, they 
pseudorandomly decide which turns to make at every intersection.


Individual Ghost Traits
==========================

- Blinky (red) target tile in Chase mode is defined as Pac-Man 
  current tile

- Pinky leaves the house at a fixed timer (5 seconds)

- Pinky (pink) target tile in Chase Mode is four tiles ahead of 
  Pac-Man

- Inky (cyan) doesn't leave the house until the player consumes 
  at least 30 dots (regular pellets)

- To locate Inky (cyan) target, we first start by selecting the 
  position two tiles in front of Pac-Man in his current direction 
  of travel. From there, create a vector from Blinky position to 
  this tile, and then double the length of the vector. The tile 
  that this new, extended vector ends on will be Inky (cyan) 
  target.

- Clyde (orange) is the last to leave the ghost house, and does 
  not exit at all in the first level until over a third of the 
  dots have been eaten.

- Whenever Clyde (orange) needs to determine his target tile, he 
  first calculates his distance from Pac-Man. If he is farther 
  than eight tiles away, his targeting is identical to Blinky 
  (chase current player tile). As soon as his distance to Pac-Man 
  becomes less than eight tiles, Clyde (orange) target is set to 
  the same tile as his fixed one in Scatter mode, just outside the 
  bottom-left corner of the maze.
